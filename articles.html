        <p class="lead">Pet hates – The chill factor</p>
        <img src="image/images/DSCN0299.JPG" class="img-fluid" alt="Thermometer">
        <p class="text-justify">The temperature of wine is one of my pet hates. I mean I do like when certain wine
          served the right
          temperature but the rough generalisation of white should be served ice cold and red should be served at room
          temperature is simply not true. Just to give you an example you cook a steak in a smoking hot griddle pan for
          a short period of time and a brisket on a low temperature for quite some time. So because it is a different
          cut you treat it differently to get a delicious result. Same applies to wine. Different styles need different
          temperatures. I used the word style deliberately. You might find it strange, but a Valpolicella, a
          light-bodied red should be served on the same temperature as a White Burgundy, a full-bodied oaked white. You
          can get a rewarding outcome if you serve them at about 13°C. Being lightly chilled will firm up mellow tannins
          in the red wine and the same temperature will open up your full-bodied white to release its lovely aromas.
          Over-chilling the white can mask all your volatile aromas and leave you with pronounced acidity. What a pity
          when you have a flavoursome wine potentially showing lots of fruits. Whereas a red wine, literally pretty much
          any red wine will lose its flavours, fruitiness over 18°C. It is the nature of alcohol. It just boils off
          taking all the freshness and aromas too. If you do not believe me, please do try it!
          So the temperature range for serving any wine is shorter than you think, about 10°C-12°C. That includes sweet
          wine, champagne, fino sherry, claret, Amarone della Valpolicella and Vintage port. It starts at well chilled
          at 6°C and ends at room temperature which is 18°C. Now you think that 18°C is not really room temperature.
          Well, it kind of was when the good people of France came up with it couple of hundred years ago when there
          were no central heating, air-conditioning or refrigerator in sight. They relied on cellars that gave constant
          temperature (8°C-12°C) through seasons.

        <p class="text-justify">The age old question. Cork still seems to be the favoured method of premium producers.
          I have seen it many times when people giving a satisfied look when they realise the bottle they got, ordered,
          chose has a cork in it, rather than a screwcap. Somehow it looks more elegant, more traditional in some ways.
          Cork is still the most widely used form of closure, although approximately 5% of all wine closed with cork
          spoilt by cork taint. The cause is the presence of TCA (Trichloroanisole if you are really interested) that
          gives the wine mouldy aroma. On top of the possibility of cork taint, with age the cork can fail and can cause
          oxidation, faster ageing. Given that the bottle is stored correctly with a good quality cork, some tiny amount
          of air is desirable for bottle aging in premium products.
          On cheaper wines that destined to drink young, wine producers often use synthetic, plastic corks, but they are
          not very reliable for longer periods. They tend to let excess oxygen in, and can alter the wine`s flavour. Not
          I a good way, I might add.
          Screw cap has been mastered by new world producers. It works brilliantly, seals the bottle perfectly,
          preserves fresh and fruity aromas and does not have a negative effect on the flavour of the wine. It does not
          help bottle ageing though, as it does not let any air through at all. Still no one and nothing is perfect. And
          what might be surprising it actually cost much more to use them. So if you do not have cork in your bottle, it
          does not mean that you are having something inferior. On the contrary, somebody made sure that you can enjoy a
          young, fruity early drinking wine in the best possible condition.

        <h3 id="wine-with-cheese-platter">Why wine will always taste better with a decent cheese platter?</h3>
        <p class="lead">Side notes</p>
        <img src="image/images/DSCN0315.JPG" class="img-fluid" alt="Wine and cheese">
        <p class="text-justify">
          Why, oh why would it taste better? Or worse? To be honest it is not entirely my point. I do like my cheese
          washed down with a glass of wine myself. But…
          The other day I have read this article in the The Daily Telegraph about cheese and wine. It raised some
          questions at least about how accurately the experiment and details of the experiment were described in it. The
          article says a research have been carried out by 31 wine experts sampling 4 cheeses and 4 wines.
          First and foremost, the question of experts. Just to see what study and what not, I have googled about a bit.
          You do not have to go far to find that those experts in other posts were in fact volunteers who actually like
          wine or drink wine in their private life. I do not mean to be elitist but naming them experts gives some false
          weight to make a point.
          The tasted cheeses were: a semi-hard cow`s milk Comte, a soft, washed rind, cow`s milk Epoisses, a blue,
          sheep`s milk Roquefort and a hard goat`s cheese Crottin de Chavignol. The wines were according to the article
          a sweet Pacherenc, a dry Sancerre, a full-bodied Bourgogne, and a fruitier Madiran.
          Pacherenc du Vic-Bilh AC is from the South-West Wine Region in France covering the same area as Madiran AC.
          Its white grapes varieties are mostly the indigenous Petit Manseng, Gros Manseng, Courbu, Arrufiac and
          Semillon. It can produce, dry, sweet or sparkling wines too. Because of the lack of botrytis for some sweet
          wines the grapes can undergo passerilage, a kind of drying process. These wines do not necessarily come cheap
          though.
          Sancerre is from the Central vineyards of the Loire and Sauvignon Blanc and typically dry.
          Then a full-bodied Bourgogne. At first I thought that would be a Chardonnay, as Pinot Noir in Burgundy tends
          to be fuller-bodied or the fullest bodied in its best examples from the Côte de Nuits. That narrow band of
          handful of vineyards give us the most expensive wines on the world. Vosne-Romanėe-Conti, La Tȃche,
          Gevrey-Chambertin. Do they ring a bell? Mostly Pinot Noir is light or medium bodied, when young they have
          fruity fragrance and light tannins. In other posts the Burgundy was called a spicier red. Well, that can be a
          much cheaper price range.
          Than at last, a fruitier Madiran. Well, Madiran can be made of 100% Tannat, which is a black grape variety and
          famously tough. It is so tannic that several wine making techniques being used and one was purposefully
          developed to soften wine made out of Tannat. One of the methods is blending. Blending with Cabrenet Sauvignon,
          Cabrenet Franc and a local variety called Fer. Imagine a wine which can be softened by adding Caberenet
          Sauvignon. They use destemming, gentle pressing, new oak barrels, prolonged bottle ageing, micro-oxidisation
          and the result can be a concentrated, fruitier wine with riper tannins. It is not unlike a higher-end
          Bordeaux.
          So these wines are not just any wines, but the description of them is rather vague and misleading. Or just has
          forgotten to check the correct terms? In other articles the selection of wines was described slightly
          differently too. So possibly the volunteers tasted some world class, rather expensive wine and they found that
          if they eat cheese with them, their flavour was enhanced and their enjoyment improved.
          The process itself was not exactly pairing or matching at all, more like tasting. This resulted a bold
          statement that any cheese probably makes any wine taste better and improves its fruitiness and bouquet. I can
          see that it could be true in certain cases, but in almost all!? I must say that is a tall order. I tell you
          why. Wine and cheese matching (or not matching) is a tricky business at best. Against popular belief cheese is
          not specifically red wine friendly. I know, port. But port is rather lucky for being fruity, sweet and high in
          alcohol. It does not mean though, that it goes very well with just any cheese. It all depends on texture,
          weight the presence of umami and the counter-acting effect of salt and acidity. White wine works so much
          better in many cases. Umami is a distinctively savoury taste that makes tannic wines to taste even harsher,
          makes it more astringent and bitter. A rich, ripe, pungent soft cheese like Epoisses which is high in umami is
          a kind of faux pas to pair with a Madiran. A Burgundy would work better, but to be honest I would not bother
          with red at all. Go with a flavoursome, fruity Sauterne or even Pacherenc.
          Rich and creamy texture has a mouth-coating effect that impairs your sense of taste. That comes up as a
          positive consequence in the article. It appears to be as a very much welcomed lubrication, a help of
          counter-balancing the astringent tannins. As far as I can see it is not improving the flavour, more like
          masking it. Like I do not like every cheese and certain wines are just not my cup of tea, but I would not pour
          a glass of lemonade into my young Bordeaux just to make it more palatable.
          I very much appreciate studies about wine and food because they are making us understand more about the
          interactions between food and wine. The study, if you read the more detailed description in the Washington
          Post, actually a really interesting one. It gives an exciting angle of understanding how our senses work. I
          just think that the wrong conclusion has been emphasised. Even the researchers say, they have not come to a
          final assumption. So probably any cheese can be improved by any wine? No ultimate decision has been reached.

        <p class="lead">What do you really mean?</p>
        <img src="image/images/DSCN0315.JPG" class="img-fluid" alt="Wine bottles">
        <p class="text-justify">It seems to me, and it is not just a bit funny, that people consider dry wine somehow
          superior or more
          sophisticated. 9 out of 10 will aim to order dry wine and have a somehow snobbish attitude towards anything
          even slightly sweeter. But this frowning stance changes when it finally comes to a decision. Strangely they
          end up having an inexpensive New World white or red which is most likely to be off-dry. It has a bit off
          sweetness to it. We talk dry and drink off-dry. How peculiar!
          I am almost always get somewhat nervous, when people asking for certain types, or styles of wine. How often I
          was told to get a glass of medium white wine and when I was about to offer let`s say a Riesling Kabinet, the
          esteemed guest just answered her own question by requesting `oh, no. Something more like a Pinot Grigio`. (I
          know that offering anything German is risky business at best and very much frowned upon for traditional
          reasons, but it does worth a try.) On another occasion the wish was for a bone-dry white, but the Italian
          Pinot Grigio was declined and she finally settled with a Sauvignon Blanc from New Zealand or at another time
          with a slightly oaked Australian Chardonnay. The mind boggles. On attempts to get some helpful information
          squeezed out from the guest to help me to find the right wine, the answers just made me more confused.
          Firstly, what do they really mean by medium? How sweet the wine in question? I think people happily mix up two
          very different things like body and sweetness. They are not necessarily interchangeable. A Riesling Kabinet is
          usually a light bodied, aromatic white wine with medium sweetness, a Pinot Grigio is a light bodied, crisp,
          very much favourless white, with approximately 2-4 g of residual sugar per litre, which is virtually
          non-detectable. That is what you would call dry or probably more likely bone-dry. A simple Chablis would fit
          the bill in the dry group.
          Secondly, the happy medium covers a rather broad range of sweetness from medium dry to medium sweet. At this
          level, you can distinctively taste sugar but it is not sweet enough to match it with desserts. Medium dry is
          your Vouvray Demi Sec or a Demi Sec Champagne, whereas medium sweet is Vouvray Moelleux or a Riesling Kabinet.
          Sauternes is in the sweet category and a Trockenbeerenauslese is in the luscious as it is very sweet.
          There are other factors that can add a perception of sweetness to the wine or mask the sweetness, like
          acidity.
          I know, it is not actually that straight-forward, but why bother than with any classification if we do not
          know or we are not honest about what we really want? On the other hand be just slightly more adventurous, it
          is worth to peek out of the box!

        <img src="image/images/DSCN0299.JPG" class="img-fluid" alt="Sauvignon Blanc">
        <p class="text-justify">When drinking and enjoying wine, I try mostly not the top, well-established flagship
          products, that is why
          you attend wine tastings for, but the humble, everyday ones. Obviously budget is an issue for most of us! So
          the way I see this, you should appreciate the modest fells with stunning views, not just the Mount Everest.
          That is out of reach for most people. Cheap, or reasonably priced does not necessarily means bad quality. No
          need to be snobbish about it. And to be fair they are well-worth trying as well.
          Lately Sauvignon Blanc become a very fashionable grape variety and everyone seems to be rather fond of
          anything from Marlborough, New Zealand. My perception about it was mostly that they were a bit over the top,
          a bit too easy-drinking, too much like a punch in your face, overwhelming, therefore not very sophisticated
          or elegant. That was my snooty, wine-buff stance more or less. I was always rather suspicious with them, and
          liked to opt for a South-African one, or a French one. The French flair, I suppose. I found them more
          subtle. Somehow better.
          Recently I have tried a Sauvignon Blanc, by chance, that really did make me think and shake me up about how
          a certain style of wine can be superior, and classy. It was not the usual staff. Gave me a run for my money.
          It was restrained, refined with depth and elegance. Stylish yet a wine with class. All those clues that I
          should not have found in that bottle, yet they were there. It tasted more like a good Pouilly-Fume to me
          than a typical Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc.
          It had the pronounced nose, but with less overbearing fruit and more vegetal complexity. Like it was
          fermented on higher temperature, which is really not characteristic to New Zealand. You could find the
          tell-tale ripe gooseberry, with a bit of passionfruit and grass, but with nettle, bruised leaf and a
          definitive creaminess, and a silky smooth texture. That, my friends, is quite odd as far as I am concerned
          for Sauvignon Blanc. But a good and well placed odd on this occasion, I might add. Creaminess is a result of
          the decision of the wine maker. An outcome that can be eliminated, if undesirable. It covers series of
          chemical reactions that result a harsher acid becoming a mellower acid and translates as a creamy mouthfeel
          to you and me. The interesting thing is that an aromatic grape such as Sauvignon Blanc does not really
          benefit from it at all. Because it can lose the very much welcomed and loved volatile fruits. And you want
          to keep the zingy acidity, the crispness to hold the fruitiness in place. And somehow here we are a bottle,
          that cost slightly less than a tenner, and even I could detect some very elegant answers to the question,
          how to make a bottle of wine memorable. I can sense how beautifully well-made wine I am drinking, how much
          effort really went into it. That is where I am at. Startled. Startled by my own prejudice. Startled by how
          difficult to make a wine that stands out, but if it does, certainly worth exploring it.
          And just be humble…

        <p class="lead">The clothes of the emperor</p>
        <img src="image/images/DSCN0316.JPG" class="img-fluid" alt="Landscape of winery">
        <p class="text-justify">I attended a wine tasting lately where I had the chance to taste some natural wines.
          Natural wines are
          supposed to be even better for you than plain, old normal wines as they use less, very minimal amount of
          chemicals to make them longer lasting. They do not filter it or treat it as much, so most of them came with
          lees to be able to give you a much more natural product.
          Well, this all sounds really nice, but to be fair, most of the presented wines were pretty much unpalatable
          for me. That made me think quite a lot as I would like to think that I do have a better than average nose
          and appreciation towards wine. Actually I am rather open towards, new grapes new technics and trends,
          moreover I do train myself even at home with some pretty geeky wine stuff. Not to mention WSET wine courses
          that I have passed. On this occasion it was almost impossible for me to overlook the bouquet. Well, in most
          cases, they stunk, if I am perfectly honest. The clarity again, was very much unappealing. How can you serve
          a sparkling wine without agitating a rather copious amount of sediment? No matter what you do you end up
          with a pongy, murky plonk. The most unpleasant of all was a Spanish orange wine, some £20 a bottle. It was
          virtually undrinkable for me. It made me gag. The very traditional method, fermenting whole bunches in a
          clay pot, resulted a rather tannic white wine with an orange hue. The nose was overwhelmingly strong and
          hostile. Covered everything. I could not facilitate it whatsoever.
          There were some wines that tasted actually nice and managed to air them enough to open them up and loose
          some of the quite farmyard-ish aroma. It was difficult to decide at that point that I was enjoying these
          latter wines because they were actually quite good or just because the ones before were so disagreeable.
          So here I am and thinking. Did my senses just were not working properly? Do I not have a skill to recognise
          true, maybe outstanding quality? I mean the presenter was pretty much content that we were having some
          excellent, very good value wine. I just could not see and sense what he could.? Well, I do not know the
          answer. To be able to have some clarity I should taste those wines again, but I am not sure I want to. First
          and foremost, they were very pricy. Most of them easily over £15-£20.
          I can see in many wines I have tasted if, although they are not my cup of tea, but they are well-made, they
          have a decent quality. Some of the selection of natural wines I have already encountered I must admit, were
          just not there. They were simply bad, not very well-made, impossible to enjoy. I understand that being
          natural makes these wines a healthier alternative that is closer to nature, but what you gain by that you
          lose it on flavour and aroma. And as far as I am concerned I drink wine to appreciate it, not necessarily
          for its health benefits. So what is the point of all this? I do not it walnuts with their shells either. I
          know it is part of it, this is the way the naturally occur, but it does not really add to the experience.

          What a lovely gadget! And a great idea indeed. Coravin is a rather wonderful contraption for avid wine
          lovers. By using it you can get a glass of wine out of a bottle without opening it up and keep the remains
          fresh and untouched by oxygen. Well, given that the bottle has a cork in it rather than a screwcap. So
          safety is first. You need to put a custom made sleeve on the bottle before all the magic happens as it gets
          pressurized. If it is an older bottle, it may shatter. You clamp the implement on and through the covering
          foil and cork you push a surgical needle into the bottle. From a little argon gas filled cylinder you
          release gas into the bottle and hey presto, you can pour your wine through a valve by tilting the bottle. It
          is rather useful for expensive wines with the ability for ageing as you can check your beloved liquid
          whether it is ready or in a dire need of further maturation. Because of the cork`s natural elasticity after
          the removal of the needle the stopper seals itself, so no harm done.
          However, for the first time of using your Coravin, I would suggest for you not to make the mistake of trying
          your most expensive and most revered 30 years old Bordeaux. As I did. You really need to get the hang of how
          to use this tool. Get some practice on some cheaper stuff and be particularly cautious with sediment. I
          managed to disturb the rather heavy deposit in my carefully racked bottle, so I ended up with a pretty hazy
          glass of wine. Nonetheless, it was delicious and had a fantastic nose with ripe fruits, with slight
          leather-y, tobacco-y complexity.
          The price of this remarkable system is high as you would expect, around £200. Obviously you need to buy
          cylinders separately. But I mean, come on! What an excellent piece of equipment!

        <p class="text-justify article-text-font">I suppose, Gros Manseng is a pretty unknown grape variety, unfortunately. I am the sort
          of person who
          actually likes to try unfamiliar grapes, not just standard Chardonnay and Cabernet Sauvignon. You can find
          some pretty amazing stuff out there if you look and there is such a variety. I think that is one of the
          things that makes wine so exciting, colourful, different, sophisticated. Why cannot get excited by a
          Bonarda? A good Gruner Veltliner or Albarhino? Have I mentioned Torrontes yet?
          Gros Manseng is a French grape variety primarily produced in Jurançon in South-West France and Gascogny. You
          can find it in blends, but also as a single varietal. It produces intensely flavoured, aromatic wines with
          fruity floral aromas and zingy acidity. Traditionally used for sweet white wine, but depending on the level
          of ripeness and the way it has been handled it can result very different dry white wines. Rather great white
          wines with spice, quince and apricot. It reminds me slightly to Gewurtztraminer.
          I have tried one the other day and I was pleasantly surprised. I am not going to write tasting notes and
          all, because my point is anyway that do not afraid to go with something different. Because they are not
          well-known, well-established they are very reasonably priced. You can get real value for money.
