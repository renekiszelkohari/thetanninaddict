# The Tannin Addict

In this project I am creating a **wine blog**. If you like wines and intrested in an expertises thoughts about *tasting* it, *making* it, the *science* behind it, or you just simply like *traveling*, then this website is for you. Even if wine is not your cup of tea you will still find plenty of interesting information about places as potential holdiday destinations. Have a peek at the *gallery* to dismiss your doubts. 


## UX:

This website is for my wife. She has come to a decision to go pro as a blogger. For that reason she needs a website where she can express her thoughts  about anything related to wines.

The ultimate goal is to provide visitors visually catching website with lots of interesting articles provided with plenty of photos and videos.


## Features:

### Home
- Just a teaser to get you there. A warm welcome photo, few articles, intresting quote and a sign up button for newsletters.
- Navigation at the top allows you to navigate through the main part of the website. 
- The Wine Up! button in the navigation and on the home page takes you to a sign up page where you can fill in your details and submit it to recieve newsletters.

### About
- About page contains information about the owner of the site.

### Articles
- Articles contains the short version of the articles. By clicking on  *more* at the bottom right corner, it takes you to the actual article.

### Gallery
- Gallery provides you with photos and videos to enhance visual connection to articles.

### Features left to implement
- A lot - There is always place for improvement.
- Adding email/chat function for questions to be asked and answered.
