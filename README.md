# The Tannin Addict

In this project I am creating a **wine blog**. If you like wines and intrested in an expertise's thoughts about *tasting* it, *making* it, the *science* behind it, or you just simply like *traveling and visiting wineries*, then this website is for you. Even if wine is not your cup of tea you will still find plenty of interesting information about places as potential holiday destinations. Have a peek at the *gallery* to dismiss your doubts. 


## UX:

This website is for my wife. She has come to a decision to go pro as a blogger. For that reason she needs a website where she can express her thoughts  about anything related to wines.

The ultimate goal is to provide visitors visually catching website with lots of interesting articles provided with plenty of photos and videos.

- The Wine Up! button in the navigation and on the home page takes you to a sign up page where you can fill in your details and submit it to recieve newsletters.

### About

### Articles
